# JukeBox

OO JavaScript Jukebox

You've had a bit of time to get familiar with object oriented JavaScript. Time to use that knowledge to make the coolest juke joint in the place!

Using any mp3 you can find online, create a simple web page where you can play it. After this step, research which JavaScript functions can pause, play, and stop the Jukebox.

Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling:

`Jukebox.play()`

Your JavaScript Jukebox must:

1. Display at least one song on the page when the page loads

2. Give the user the ability to play that song, _without_ using the "built-in" play button. This could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.

3. Give the user the ability to stop that song _without_ using the "built-in" stop button. Once again, this could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.

3. Give the user the ability to load at least one different song into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page initially renders

4. The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with methods to play, stop, and load songs.
Bonus features:

1. Playlist of songs, allows the user to queue up the next song

2. Feature to request a random song
